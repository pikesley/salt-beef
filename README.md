Etymology
---------

"Treat your servers like cattle, not like pets." -- Spend your devops time
relaxing in a field, herding cattle, enjoying the rolling hills and the mildly
tempestuous weather.

There's no really good reason for naming all the commands after cow-related
activities, but then, since when was naming ever sane in technology?
